A simple project to play around with midi and generative music.  The recent inspiration is was a vague idea that it would be fun to have an OpenSCAD for music. Let's code in that direction.

The project runs as an interactive repl

#Setup

npm install

#Running:

You'll need something that receives midi commands and plays sounds.  [Plogue's Sforzand]<https://www.plogue.com/products/sforzando.html> est magnifique.

node ./no-man-band.js
